# Decisions and Guardrails

## OCR Cascade Order
**Decision:** Docling → Tesseract → Doctr for layout-aware OCR.
**Rationale:** Keeps Docling layout awareness first, with progressive fallback when confidence is low.

## OCR Confidence Threshold Governance
**Decision:** The default layout-aware OCR trigger threshold is **0.70** (`--ocr-confidence-threshold` default).

**Rationale:**
- The threshold is an empirical quality lever, not a fixed architectural invariant.
- The legacy 0.90 expectation was too aggressive in practice and increased unnecessary OCR escalation.
- Acceptance tuning showed 0.70 gives better balance between extraction fidelity and over-triggering.

**Operationalization:**
- SRS defines behavior and default, while this document records the decision basis and tuning policy.
- Any change to the default threshold must include before/after acceptance evidence.
- Validate changes with representative acceptance runs and QA outputs before adoption.

## VLM Orchestration Protocol
- Changes to classifier/orchestrator must include impact analysis against the core test matrix.
- No modality-crossing fallbacks (scanned must stay scanned; digital must stay digital).
- No hardcoded document-specific rules.

## Anti-Patterns (Explicitly Forbidden)
- Overfitting to specific filenames.
- Forcing digital_magazine as a “safe” fallback for scans.
- Treating metadata as ground-truth instead of diagnostic evidence.

## Structural Pathology over Semantic Profiling (v2.5.0)

**Decision:** PDF extraction pathway (use digital text / flat-code OCR rescue / force full OCR) is determined by **structural integrity tests** on the PDF byte-stream, not by the semantic content type (e.g., "technical_manual", "academic_whitepaper").

**Rationale:**
- Semantic content type has zero correlation with technical PDF integrity. A technical manual can be a perfectly structured PDF or a newline-stripped disaster from a broken PDF generator (e.g., Kimothi 2025, Python Distilled). Routing on semantic labels causes silent quality failures.
- Three structural tests are sufficient to classify PDF health before any extraction begins:
  1. **Line-break health** (words/`\n` ratio on sample pages) — free, < 1 ms/page.
  2. **Visual-digital delta** (PyMuPDF text vs Tesseract OCR word-set overlap on one page) — definitive, ~300 ms.
  3. **Geometry error rate** (MuPDF path-syntax error count) — logging and risk signal only.
- Semantic profiles continue to govern VLM prompt context, extraction sensitivity, and image thresholds — they remain useful for *what to describe*, not for *how to extract*.

**The two-axis model:**
```
                  STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY
                  Healthy  │ Flat text  │ Encoding
                           │ corrupted  │ corrupted
  ────────────────┼──────────┼────────────┼───────────
  S digital       │ Docling  │ +flat code │ force OCR
  E               │ direct   │ OCR rescue │
  M ────────────────┼──────────┼────────────┼───────────
  A scanned       │ nuclear  │ nuclear +  │ force OCR
  N               │ OCR      │ flat rescue│
  T ────────────────┴──────────┴────────────┴───────────
  I
  C
```

**Operationalization:**
- `_perform_physical_check` in `document_diagnostic.py` runs the three tests.
- Flags `has_flat_text_corruption` and `has_encoding_corruption` added to `PhysicalCheckResult`.
- `batch_processor.py` reads these flags to activate flat-code OCR rescue and/or upgrade to forced OCR.
- Semantic profile selection is unaffected; it runs in parallel and drives VLM/sensitivity settings only.

**Anti-patterns now explicitly forbidden:**
- Using `profile_type == "technical_manual"` to decide whether OCR is needed.
- Assuming `native_digital` modality means all text is correctly encoded and formatted.

## Image Extraction Routing (v2.7.0)

**Decision:** All document types use Docling layout model for image extraction. PyMuPDF `page.get_images()` is not used in the active pipeline.

**Rationale:**
- PyMuPDF direct extraction was implemented and tested for `native_digital` PDFs (I10). It works for simple cases (technical books with discrete embedded images) but fails for:
  - **Magazines:** Composite page layouts where text and photos are baked together as single rasterized images. PyMuPDF extracts these composites whole — it cannot separate photos from text backgrounds.
  - **Academic papers:** Vector figures extracted as solid-color backgrounds.
- Docling's layout model with picture classification (`DocumentFigureClassifier-v2.5`, Docling 2.86.0) correctly identifies image regions across all document types. A deny filter rejects `full_page_image` and `page_thumbnail` layout artifacts.
- Picture classification is **disabled for scanned docs** (`scanned`, `scanned_degraded`) because the classifier model hangs on large scanned books with hundreds of image regions (tested: 292-page Firearms on 16GB M1).
- The PyMuPDF `_extract_embedded_images` method is retained in the codebase for future use. The proper fix for magazine image quality is the rendered-region-crop architecture (tracked in `CONVERSION_PROFILES.md`).

## Heal-Over for Encoding Corruption (v2.7.0)

**Decision:** When encoding corruption is detected (`has_encoding_corruption`), keep HybridChunker active and force the semantic refiner on all chunks at `threshold=0.0`, instead of disabling HybridChunker and falling back to full OCR.

**Rationale:**
- Disabling HybridChunker loses structural metadata: heading hierarchy, table structures, sentence-boundary-aware splitting.
- The refiner (LLM-based) understands language context and can replace glyph placeholders (`/C211`, `/C1`, hex leaks) with correct characters while preserving the surrounding structure.
- This "heal-over" approach preserves Docling's structural analysis as a skeleton and patches only the corrupted text content.

**Operationalization:**
- `CorruptionInterceptor` (`src/mmrag_v2/validators/corruption_interceptor.py`) performs per-bbox OCR patching at 300 DPI for chunks with detected encoding artifacts.
- The refiner threshold override is set in `batch_processor.py` when `has_encoding_corruption` is true.

---

## Multimodal Validation Layers (v2.7.0)

**Decision:** Replace heuristic string-matching loops with 4 signal-driven validation layers that use OCR confidence, VLM descriptions, and POS tagging.

**The 4 layers:**

1. **CorruptionInterceptor** — Per-bbox OCR patching for encoding artifacts. Renders only the corrupted chunk's bbox at 300 DPI, runs Tesseract, replaces content if OCR result is cleaner. Preserves HybridChunker structure.

2. **POS Boundary Logic** — Merges trailing orphan prepositions (`BY`, `FOR`, `OF`, `WITH`, `von`, `für`, `van`, `voor`, `par`, `pour`) into the next chunk when it starts with a proper noun. Same-page guard prevents cross-page false merges. The preposition must be the ONLY word on its line (true orphan).

3. **Vision-Gated Hierarchy** — When a page has cover/logo/illustration images (detected via VLM `visual_description`), demotes non-chapter headings to "Front Matter". Uses multimodal signals rather than text pattern matching.

4. **Content-Type Classification** — Chunks with 2+ boilerplate markers (ISBN, ©, "All rights reserved", "Printed in") get `search_priority` downgraded to `low`. Global rule across all profiles.

**Rationale:**
- Heuristic string matching (v2.6 approach) required per-document tuning and broke on edge cases. These layers use structural signals (OCR confidence, VLM output, POS tags) that generalize across document types.

## Chunk Size Governance
**Decision:** Chunk length is governed per profile and verified with acceptance metrics; no universal hard min/max.

**Rationale:**
- Different modalities and document classes need different chunking behavior.
- A single global threshold causes regressions (either fragmentation or oversized chunks).
- Quality must be demonstrated with repeatable benchmarks, not assumed from one document.

**Operationalization:**
- Use representative acceptance runs (e.g., `scripts/acceptance_technical_manual.sh`).
- Track both structural hygiene (`text_short_<30`, `text_long_>1500`, `infix_strict`) and coverage (`QA-CHECK-01`).
- Document any threshold/range change with baseline comparison in the run summary.
